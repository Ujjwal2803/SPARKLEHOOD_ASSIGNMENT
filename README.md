## 🧠 Design Decisions & Challenges

- Used **Vite** for superfast project setup and hot reloading.
- Adopted **TailwindCSS** to maintain a clean, scalable design system.
- Built components modularly to allow easy scalability.
- Implemented mock data first to prototype quickly without a backend.
- Focused on mobile-first responsive design early to avoid rework later.
